                                              The season kicks off with the opening of the ski resort around the first week of December. This is a great time for beginner skiers to learn stress free due to the lack of people on the slopes. Likewise, enjoy strolls through a specious Hirafu, eat at your favourite restaurants without the hassle of fighting for a reservation and watch as the landscape transforms from green to white.

As we enter January, enjoy nightly top ups of fresh snow as well as a vibrant and electric town life. The izakayas are smoking, the beer pouring and the energy in town is palpable.

This is your time for the full Japow experience. Come and experience life in white. Everywhere you look, snow will persist, creating beautiful white landscapes and even better skiing. Those wanting to experience deep powder skiing or those simply wanting to submerge in a winter wonderland, this is your time.

The town and slopes begin to quiet down and to give the resort a more intimate feel. This is a great time of the winter for beginners and experts alike. Beginners can enjoy beautiful skiing weather (sunshine) and clear views of the surrounding landscape while more advanced skiers can adventure further with a backcountry guide.
