                    Born and raised in the Argentine Patagonia, Mateo grew up skiing and hiking in the Andes Mountains. After moving to Canada and completing his studies at the University of Toronto, Mateo became obsessed with outdoor travel and exploration, visiting over 50 countries, hiking and skiing anywhere a slope presented itself. His unique world perspective, upbeat demeanour, and can-do attitude along with his profound ski talent made him the ideal winter hospitality host.

                    From a young age Laurie has always been in pursuit of a new experience, in search for a moment that could be etched in his mind.

                    <h4>We are Disciples of Experience</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our business is built on love. We’re dreamers who believe in relentlessly exploring what’s possible. We’re passionate, playful and deeply invested in our art.
                    </p>
                    <h4>We Make It Happen</h4>
                    <p>
                        Doesn’t matter what you want to create, discover or experience. We hold an unshakeable belief in possibility. That with humility, passion and focus -- we can make just about anything come to life.
                    </p>
                    <h4>We Don’t Do Mediocre</h4>
                    <p>
                        We give everything 120% and then some. We’re obsessive about exceeding expectations and going above and beyond for you, ourselves and each other.
                    </p>
                    <h4>We Offer Beyond Extraordinary</h4>
                    <p>
                        We’re really proud to design some of the best winter travel experiences in the world. Our goal is to have every guest feel blown-away by their experience and know they’re aligned with a company that truly cares about them for the long-haul.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Trust is everything</h4>
                    <p>
                        We’re plain-speakers who mean what we say. We’re honest with our customers, our audience and each other. If our training programs aren’t right for you, we’ll say so. When mistakes happen, we take responsibility and work our tails off to make things right.
                    </p>
                    <h4>We love our customers</h4>
                    <p>
                        You’re the reason we exist. You help us create meaningful change in this world. We’re obsessive about customer happiness, responding to emails and working non-stop to make sure you feel as valued, respected and appreciated as you truly are.
                    </p>
                    <h4>We’re not for everyone</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our sense of humour is off-beat and our sense of optimism is unstoppable. We’re irreverent and straight shooting. We take a strong stand for kindness. We take our work seriously, but not ourselves.
